Description: ACME client implemented in Bash
 The dehydrated ACME client allows signing certificates with an
 ACME server, like the one provided by the Letâ€™s Encrypt certificate
 authority (letsencrypt.org).  It is implemented as a relatively simple
 Bash script, which uses curl to communicate with the ACME server and
 OpenSSL to deal with keys, sign requests and certificates.
 .
 The ACME (Automated Certificate Management Environment) protocol makes
 it possible to automatically obtain browser-trusted certificate.
